# **Pricing European Options Using Advanced Financial Models and Numerical Methods**

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to price European options using various financial models and numerical methods, analyze the volatility smile and surface, and compare the convergence speeds of different Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The key steps include:

1. **Black-Scholes Model**:
   - Implement the Black-Scholes formula to price European call and put options.
   - Analyze the sensitivity of option prices to model parameters (Greeks).

2. **Monte Carlo Simulations**:
   - Simulate asset price paths using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**.
   - Discretize the GBM using:
     - **Euler-Maruyama Stochastic Scheme**.
     - **Milstein Scheme** (for improved accuracy).
   - Use the simulated paths to estimate option prices under the risk-neutral measure.
   - Compare the convergence speeds of the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein schemes.

3. **Heston Model**:
   - Implement the **Heston Stochastic Volatility Model** to simulate asset price and volatility paths.
   - Use Monte Carlo simulations to price European options under the Heston model.
   - Assume that the market price of the option is equal to the price simulated by the Heston model.

4. **Volatility Smile and Surface**:
   - Plot the **volatility smile** by calculating implied volatilities for options with different strike prices.
   - Generate the **volatility surface** by extending the analysis to options with different maturities.
   - Compare the volatility smile and surface generated by the Heston model with those implied by the Black-Scholes model.

5. **Convergence Analysis**:
   - Compare the convergence speeds of the Monte Carlo methods (Euler-Maruyama and Milstein) for both GBM and Heston models.
   - Analyze the computational efficiency and accuracy of each method.

## **Key Components**

### 1. **Black-Scholes Model**
   - Use the Black-Scholes formula:
     \[
     C = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2),
     \]
     where:
     \[
     d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0 / K) + (r + \sigma^2 / 2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}, \quad d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}.
     \]
   - Compute the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, etc.) to understand the sensitivity of option prices to model inputs.

### 2. **Monte Carlo Simulations**
   - **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**:
     \[
     dS_t = r S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t,
     \]
     where \( r \) is the risk-free rate, \( \sigma \) is the volatility, and \( W_t \) is a Wiener process.
   - **Discretization Schemes**:
     - **Euler-Maruyama**:
       \[
       S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t + r S_t \Delta t + \sigma S_t \Delta W_t.
       \]
     - **Milstein** (for improved accuracy):
       \[
       S_{t+\Delta t} = S_t + r S_t \Delta t + \sigma S_t \Delta W_t + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S_t (\Delta W_t^2 - \Delta t).
       \]
   - Simulate multiple paths and compute the option price as the discounted expected payoff:
     \[
     \text{Price} = e^{-rT} \mathbb{E}[\max(S_T - K, 0)] \quad (\text{for a call option}).
     \]

### 3. **Heston Model**
   - Simulate the joint dynamics of the asset price \( S_t \) and its volatility \( v_t \):
     \[
     dS_t = r S_t dt + \sqrt{v_t} S_t dW_t^1,
     \]
     \[
     dv_t = \kappa (\theta - v_t) dt + \xi \sqrt{v_t} dW_t^2,
     \]
     where:
     - \( \kappa \) is the mean-reversion rate,
     - \( \theta \) is the long-term volatility,
     - \( \xi \) is the volatility of volatility,
     - \( W_t^1 \) and \( W_t^2 \) are correlated Wiener processes with correlation \( \rho \).
   - Use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate option prices under the Heston model.

### 4. **Volatility Smile and Surface**
   - Compute implied volatilities for options with different strike prices and maturities.
   - Plot the **volatility smile** (implied volatility vs. strike price) and the **volatility surface** (implied volatility vs. strike price and maturity).
   - Compare the results from the Heston model with those from the Black-Scholes model.

### 5. **Convergence Analysis**
   - Compare the convergence speeds of the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein schemes for both GBM and Heston models.
   - Analyze the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy for each method.
